        <!-- 2. FRAMING -->
        <p class="about-subtitle">
          I’m a computer science undergraduate focused on backend systems,
          automation, and what happens after code ships to production.
        </p>

        <!-- 3. HOW I WORK -->
        <p class="about-text">
          Work stays close to the problem: designing APIs with clear contracts, tracing data flow across services, and
          handling edge cases instead of hiding them behind abstractions. The focus is on understanding why something
          breaks, especially when behavior changes outside controlled environments.
        </p>

        <!-- 4. DIRECTION -->
        <p class="about-text">
          Currently looking for early-career roles that involve real systems, learning from experienced engineers, and
          shipping code that actually gets used. Environments where correctness and long-term maintainability matter
          more than moving fast without understanding trade-offs are a strong fit.
        </p>

        <!-- 5. PRINCIPLE -->
        <p class="about-principle">
          I care about correctness first, clarity second, and scale when it matters.
        </p>
